               <p>The application of artificial intelligence technology in education is gradually transforming the face of traditional education.

However, AI education nowadays pays too much attention to knowledge itself and neglects the cultivation of soft qualities such as values. The fundamental task of education is to cultivate people with independent character, correct values and moral character. Starting from primary school, we go through different courses to mould our character. Learning history, learning to respect the past; learning biology, learning to tolerate and co-exist; learning maths, learning to think rationally; learning language, learning to communicate. The current AI education, which focuses more on combing knowledge, etc., the user faces a knowledge point, improves the ability to take a test, but it is difficult to improve their values in a simple and fast Internet learning scenario. Big data is the cornerstone of AI, which can have millions of kinds of knowledge samples, but the data on the human spirit, values, and soul is almost 0. And this is the most valuable thing in education.</p>
