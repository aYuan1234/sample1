        <h1 class="top-text">Identify and ameliorate social inequalities</h1>
        <p class="descriptions">Social inequality has always been a problem that all countries want to solve, and AI can help local governments identify target populations and implement assistance through data collection, data analysis and other methods.</p>
    
        <h2>Identify the target population</h2>
        <br>
        <p>AI is able to analyze the characteristics of the target population through different aspects of data collection.
            On the neighborhood side, through geospatial data and survey data, AI is able to assess population density and the height of buildings. Based on this data, AI can identify the presence of slums and which characteristics are associated with community life in slums. Examples include race, religion, high female fertility, low school attendance, etc.</p>

            <p align="center"><br><br>In terms of cities, using high-resolution imagery from satellites, street maps, points of interest such as hospitals and schools, and surface height data, AI can identify target cities based on socio-economic conditions, access to facilities and services, and agricultural production conditions.</p>

        <p align="center">At the county level, AI can use night satellite maps to view the night light intensity in different areas, so as to judge the degree of development of different counties, so as to target counties and towns.
        <br>
        <br>
        In terms of countries, AI can collect data on the number of children in asset poverty and unhealthy weight in each country, and analyze these data with indicators such as geographical location characteristics in each region to target countries.</p>

            .country{display:flex;

        </style>
        <p>All in all, in the face of a large number of databases and complex data, AI can help effectively and quickly analyze and organize, so as to help the government accurately find the target population that needs to strengthen facilities or welfare.</p>
        
        <div class="assist">
        <h2>Assist the target population</h2>
        <p>In agriculture, for example, AI technology can monitor crop growth, soil quality assessment, pest warning and pesticide facility optimization through data such as drones, sensors and big data analytics. Thereby increasing agricultural productivity and efficiency.</p>
        <p>For some low-development areas, AI can also be used to promote innovation and development of local industries. Promote the digital transformation of local industries, introduce new business models and technologies, and promote the diversified development of the region.</p>
